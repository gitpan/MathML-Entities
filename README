NAME
    MathML::Entities - Convert XHTML+MathML Named Entities to Numeric
    Character References

SYNOPSIS
     use MathML::Entities;
 
     $html    = '<b>&copy;</b> by me';
 
     # convert named HTML entities to character references:
     $numeric = name2numbered($html);    # <b>&#x000A9;</b> by me

     # convert named HTML entities to character references:
     $utf8 = name2utf8($html);    # utf8 
 
DESCRIPTION
    MathML::Entities a content conversion filter for named XHTML+MathML
    entities. There are over two thousand named entities in the XHTML+MathML
    DTD. All the Entities defined in the XHTML+MathML DTD except the five
    "safe" ones ("&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", "&quot;", "&apos;"), will be
    converted to the equivalent numeric character references or to utf-8
    characters. Named entities which are not in the XHTML+MathML DTD are
    escaped. This makes the resulting XHTML (or XHTML+MathML) safe for
    consumption by non-validating XML parsers.

    Unlike, HTML::Entities, the mapping between MathML named entities and
    codepoints is many-to-one. Therefore, there's no particular sense in
    having an inverse function, which takes codepoints to named entities.

    Based on: HTML::Entities by Koichi Taniguchi <taniguchi@livedoor.jp>

FUNCTIONS
    The following functions are exported by default.

    * name2numbered
        XHTML+MathML named entities (except for the five "safe" XML named
        entities) in the argument of "name2numbered()" are replaced by the
        corresponding numbered character references.

    * name2utf8
        XHTML+MathML named entities (except for the five "safe" XML named
        entities) in the argument of "name2utf8()" are replaced by the
        corresponding utf-8 characters.
